            <h3 class="text-animation">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Supply Chain and Logistics Technology with a concentration in System Management, I bring a growing combination of technical knowledge, real-world project experience, and a strong passion for using technology to solve problems and improve systems. My academic background has given me a solid foundation in systems thinking, data tools, and logistics operations, which I continue to build on both inside and outside the classroom. I’m committed to continuous learning and actively pursue professional certifications from respected institutions such as CompTIA, the Project Management Institute (PMI), and SAP. In my free time, I explore emerging technologies, practice my technical skills, and stay current with industry tools and trends across tech and supply chain management. Whether I’m coding a project, organizing tasks for a team, or diving into independent research, I approach every opportunity with curiosity, creativity, and a hands-on mindset. I’m eager to continue gaining experience in real-world environments where I can contribute meaningfully, grow my skill set, and work on impactful projects alongside innovative teams.</p>
